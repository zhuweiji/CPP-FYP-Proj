The following knowledge is presumed:
    1. Basic Data Structures (e.g. ints, bools, lists)
    2. Loops and If Statements
    3. Functions


# Hello World

When writing a C++ program, you must first write the `main()` function, which serves as the entry point to the program.
This is where the C++ compiler will look to start your code. 

This is similar to the `public static void main(string args)` method of Java.
