# Hello there!

Welcome to Comprehend C++. This is a notebook, where we will introduce new concepts and you can try them out yourself with the code editors provided.

# Prerequisites

This course assumes that you have some basic familiarity with programming. 
The following knowledge is presumed:
    1. Basic Data Structures (e.g. ints, bools, lists)
    2. Loops and If Statements
    3. Functions

# Hello World

When writing a C++ program, you must first write the `main()` function, which serves as the entry point to the program.
This is where the C++ compiler will look to start your code. 

This is similar to the `public static void main(string args)` method of Java.

Below, we have a file with just a function, a(), but no main function. Try running it, and see what happens! You should get an error, telling you that main() was not defined.

<Editor defaultvalue={

int main() {
    return 0;
}}>

Here we have another program with a main() function.  

<Editor defaultvalue={

int main() {
    return 0;
}}>


# Library functions: std::cin and std:: cout
