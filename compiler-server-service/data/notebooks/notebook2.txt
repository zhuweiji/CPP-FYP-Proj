# Value and List Instantialization 

There are several ways to initialize (create) a variable.


<Editor defaultvalue={#include <iostream>
int main() {
    int a;         // no initializer (default initialization)

    int b = 5;     // initializer after equals sign (copy initialization)
    int c { 6 };   // initializer in braces (direct list initialization)
    int d {};      // initializer is empty braces (value initialization)

    int e( 7 );    // initializer in parenthesis (direct initialization)
    int f = { 8 }; // initializer in braces after equals sign (copy list initialization)


    return 0;

[Best Practice]
Try to initialize variables with a value if possible.


## Copy Initialization 

<Code value={int b = 5;
} Code>

This is the format that is most like other programming languages you may have seen.

The value of 5 is copied into b after the variable is created. 


## Brace Initialization 

<Code value={int c{5};
} Code>

This is similar to the above, except that it also disallows narrowing conversions. \
Narrowing conversions are when data is converted to another type (such as float to int) and a loss in information occurs.

If you try to initialize a variable with a value that the variable cannot safely hold, a compiler error results.



<Editor noerror={true} defaultvalue={#include <iostream>
int main() {
    int yourMoney__millions { 1.5 };  
    std::cout << yourMoney__millions;

    return 0;
}} Editor>




<Editor noerror={true} defaultvalue={#include <iostream>
int main() {
    int yourMoney__millions = 1.5;  
    std::cout << yourMoney__millions;
    
    return 0;
}} Editor>



## Default Initialization

This creates a variable with no value.

If forget to assign this value before using it, then your program will exhibit undefined behavior.

Code implementing undefined behavior may exhibit any of the following symptoms: \
Your program produces different results every time it is run.
Your program consistently produces the same incorrect result.
Your program behaves inconsistently (sometimes produces the correct result, sometimes not).
Your program seems like its working but produces incorrect results later in the program.
Your program crashes, either immediately or later.
Your program works on some compilers but not others.
Your program works until you change some other seemingly unrelated code.

With the compiler we are using, the value is zero-initialized (it will have a default value of 0), although the behavior may change depending on the compiler.
